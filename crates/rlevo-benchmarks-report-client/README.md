# rlevo-benchmarks-report-client

Leptos/WASM client for the [rlevo-benchmarks](../rlevo-benchmarks/) static-HTML
report (Milestone 5.1).

This crate is **not** a build-time or runtime dependency of any production
`rlevo` crate. It produces a WASM blob + JS shim + CSS bundle that the
`rlevo-benchmarks::report::html::emit_static_html` function optionally
inlines into a single self-contained `index.html`.

## Build

The build is **out-of-band** — `cargo build -p rlevo-benchmarks` does not
invoke trunk. Run trunk explicitly when you change the client:

```bash
# One-time toolchain setup
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
cargo install trunk

# Build (run from this crate's directory)
cd crates/rlevo-benchmarks-report-client
trunk build --release
```

`trunk build --release` produces a `dist/` directory containing:

```
dist/
├── rlevo-benchmarks-report-client.js        ← wasm-bindgen JS shim
├── rlevo-benchmarks-report-client_bg.wasm   ← compiled WASM module
├── app.css                                  ← bundled styles
└── index.html                               ← standalone shell (unused by the inliner)
```

The host-side emitter loads these via `ClientAssets::from_trunk_dist(&dir)`.

## Architecture

The client decodes the four stable `<script>` block ids the M5 emitter
inlines into every report:

| Script id | Type | Content |
|-----------|------|---------|
| `rlevo-manifest` | `application/json` | `RunManifest` (run id, env family, seed, hyperparameters, plus ADR-0014 run provenance) |
| `rlevo-warnings` | `application/json` | `[OpenWarning]` non-fatal load conditions |
| `rlevo-episode-index` | `application/json` | `[EpisodeMeta]` summary per episode |
| `rlevo-episode-NNNNNN` | `application/octet-stream` | Base64-encoded raw `.rec` bytes (16-byte preamble + bincode header + length-prefixed `RecordChunk`s) |

`src/wire.rs` is a **bincode-compatible mirror** of
`rlevo-benchmarks::record::schema`. The cross-crate test
`tests/wire_format_compat.rs` in the host crate round-trips a populated
record through both sides on every `cargo test`, so any field-order or
field-type drift fails the host test suite.

`src/inline_data.rs` is the DOM glue — `read_manifest()` /
`read_episode_index()` / `read_warnings()` / `read_episode_record(id)`.

`src/app.rs` is the Leptos app: manifest header + warnings banner +
interactive episode table + per-episode detail pane.

## M6 — per-family playback adapters

M5.1 shipped a static frame dump; **M6** turns the per-episode detail
pane into a true playback surface:

- **Timeline scrubber** (`<input type="range">`) drives a `frame_idx`
  Leptos signal across `record.frames`.
- **Play / Pause / Restart** with **1× / 2× / 5× / 10×** speed buttons.
  The play loop runs a single `set_interval_with_handle`; it auto-pauses
  at the terminal frame, and `on_cleanup` clears the handle whenever the
  selected episode changes.
- **Per-frame readout**: `frame i/N · step N · reward ±X.XXX`.
- **Styled-frame HTML rendering** (`src/styled.rs`): wire-mirror
  `StyledFrame` → `<pre>` + colour-classed `<span>`s. Pair every colour
  with a hue-redundant signal (`font-weight: 700` for BOLD, CSS
  `currentColor` swap for REVERSED) so a B/W screenshot still conveys
  agent / goal / hazard meaning.
- **Family dispatch** off `manifest.env_family` (`src/adapters/mod.rs`):
  - `Classic` (CartPole / MountainCar / Pendulum / Acrobot).
  - `Grids` (Minigrid-style envs — agent heading glyphs, walls, goals, hazards).
  - `ToyText` (FrozenLake, CliffWalking, Taxi, Blackjack — tile grid + agent).
  - Box2d / Landscapes / Locomotion ship M7 SVG adapters — see below.
  - Any future family hits the generic fallback adapter until a
    dedicated one lands.

The umbrella crate ships one combined example per covered family —
`report_ppo_cartpole_with_client`, `report_grids_with_client`,
`report_toy_text_with_client` — each of which records a run and wraps it
into a single-file HTML report in one binary (see `rlevo-examples`).

## M7 — per-family SVG adapters for box2d, landscapes, locomotion

M7 lights up the report tier for the three remaining 2D families. The
wire format bumps to **`FORMAT_VERSION = 2`** — M6 records (version 1)
still decode through the same loader because `FamilyPayload::Ascii`
stays at bincode tag 0, so the v1 tag layout is preserved.

- **`Landscape2D`** payload — search-domain bounds, current candidate,
  best-so-far, capped trail, landscape label. The
  `adapters/landscape.rs` SVG renders a closed-form fitness heatmap
  background (sphere / ackley / rastrigin, monochrome low→high ramp) +
  trail polyline + current-position disk + best-so-far cross-ring.
- **`Locomotion2D`** payload — **the canonical view for the family**,
  since locomotion envs do not implement `AsciiRenderable` per
  ADR-0008. The `adapters/locomotion.rs` SVG renders a sagittal-plane
  stick figure: bones, joint disks, ground line, optional CoM cross,
  contact rings. Auto-fits the viewport with a minimum half-range so a
  static pose still renders visibly.
- **`Box2dBodies`** payload — per-body polygon transforms keyed off the
  `BodyKind` discriminant (hull / wheel / leg / wing / ground / goal /
  other), plus contact points. The `adapters/box2d.rs` SVG transforms
  each body's local-frame vertices into world space via the captured
  `(position, rotation_rad)` pose.

Per the project accessibility contract, every colour pairs with a
distinct shape / stroke style (joints filled disks, CoM cross, contacts
open rings, ground dashed, trail dim-dashed), so a black-and-white
screenshot of the report still reads.

### Producer-side opt-in

Envs become payload sources by implementing one of:

- `rlevo_core::render::Landscape2DPayloadSource`
- `rlevo_core::render::Box2dPayloadSource`
- `rlevo_core::render::Locomotion2DPayloadSource`

`RecordingTap` then exposes per-family convenience constructors —
`with_landscape_payload(env, sink)` / `with_box2d_payload(env, sink)` /
`with_locomotion_payload(env, sink)` — that wire the snapshot into
every captured frame. Locomotion routes through a new
`RecordingTap::new_headless` constructor that drops the
`AsciiRenderable` bound; ASCII / styled fields ship as `None` and the
M7 SVG is the only rendering pathway.

The umbrella crate ships one combined M7 example per family:

- `report_sphere_landscape_with_client` (writes via `RecordSink` directly
  — landscapes are pure fitness functions, not Environments).
- `report_inverted_pendulum_with_client`.
- `report_lunar_lander_with_client`.

## M8 — convergence plots

M8 lights up the report tier's training-diagnostic surface: a new
**Convergence** section between the episode table and the per-episode
playback pane renders per-run scalar charts as hand-rolled pure-Rust
SVG (`src/charts.rs` / `src/series.rs`) — no JS interop and no charting
dependency, per umbrella spec §3 constraint #6. (`leptos-chartistry`
was evaluated but dropped: its 0.2 `Line`/`Bar` primitives don't cover
the box-plot and ±std-band panels, so the whole chart layer is
hand-rolled — it appears nowhere in `Cargo.toml`.) Wire format is
unchanged — every panel below consumes data already in the M4-era
record (`MetricSample` stream, per-frame rewards).

Panel inventory (default visible):

- **Episode reward** — sum of `frame.reward` per episode, raw + rolling
  mean (N=50, shrinks to `max(1, len/4)` for short runs).
- **Episode length** — `frames.len()` per episode, same window.
- **Policy loss / Value loss / Loss** — `MetricSample` series, rolling
  mean (N=20). RL-only — absent on harness records that ship without
  `RecordingLayer`.
- **Policy entropy / Approx KL / Clip fraction** — same N=20 window.
- **Best / Mean / Worst fitness / Best fitness (ever)** — EA-only; per
  generation, no smoothing (already aggregated).

Empty panels suppress entirely, so a CartPole harness recording shows
just the two derived panels and a PPO recording shows the full RL
suite. EA runs naturally hide the RL panels and surface the
`*_fitness` series.

The raw / smoothed pair pairs **line width** (1.0 / 2.5) with colour so
a B/W screenshot still distinguishes the two — the project's
hue-redundant a11y contract. Dark-mode override blocks in `app.css`
keep mid-luma hues legible on dark canvases.

### Loading and caching

`src/inline_data.rs::read_all_episode_records()` decodes every episode
block referenced by the index on first call and caches the result in a
`OnceLock` so panel re-renders are zero-cost. Per-record decode
failures are skipped so a single malformed episode does not blank the
panel grid.

### New umbrella example

`report_ppo_cartpole_with_client` runs a headless 12 k-step PPO
training cycle on CartPole, wiring `RecordingTap` for frames and
`RecordingLayer` for the canonical metric stream, then emits the
single-file report in one shot — the natural M8 demo because it
exercises every RL canonical metric in `CANONICAL_METRICS`.

## M8.1 — population panels

M8.1 closes the EA-side half of the M8 spec row: a new **Population**
section lands between the M8 Convergence section and the per-episode
playback pane. Wire format bumps to **`FORMAT_VERSION = 3`** to carry a
new [`PopulationSample`](../rlevo-benchmarks/src/record/schema.rs) chunk
(bincode tag 2). v1 and v2 records continue to decode through the v3
loader because the new chunk tag never appears in older streams.

> The record format has since advanced to **`FORMAT_VERSION = 7`** (ADR
> 0014 — typed run-provenance fields, expanded canonical metrics,
> checkpoint refs, `EpisodeKind { Training, Evaluation }`). `src/wire.rs`
> mirrors the current schema, and the host crate's
> `tests/wire_format_compat.rs` round-trip fails on any field drift.

Panel inventory (rendered when `population_samples` is non-empty in
the run):

- **Fitness distribution per generation** — hand-rolled SVG box plot
  (no charting dependency — see the M8 note; the box-plot, whisker, and
  outlier primitives have no off-the-shelf equivalent). Per generation: filled
  `[Q1, Q3]` rectangle, horizontal median tick, vertical whiskers
  clipped at the Tukey 1.5×IQR fence, outliers as small open circles.
  Three overlay polylines (best / median / worst) pair colour with
  distinct dash patterns (`solid` / `4 2` / `1 3`) so the trio is
  distinguishable in a B/W screenshot — the project's hue-redundant
  a11y contract.
- **Diversity trace** — `(generation, diversity)` scalar series, one
  point per sample that carries a diversity value. Suppressed when no
  sample provides one (M8.1 emits `None` from the harness — see
  M8.2 deferral below).
- **Selection-pressure indicator** — `best / median` ratio per
  generation, skipping zero-median degeneracy. Reuses the M8
  `interactive_line_view`.

### Producer surface

[`rlevo_evolution::PopulationObserver`](../rlevo-evolution/src/observer.rs)
is the EA-side hook the report producer attaches to. Wiring:

```text
EvolutionaryHarness::new(...)
    .with_observer(reporter.clone())
                  ↓ on_population(snapshot)        (per generation,
PopulationReporter                                  post-Strategy::tell)
    ↓ sink.lock().on_population_sample(sample)
Arc<Mutex<dyn RecordSink>>                          → RecordChunk::Population
                                                      → .rec stream
```

`PopulationReporter` is shipped from
[`rlevo_benchmarks::record::population_reporter`](../rlevo-benchmarks/src/record/population_reporter.rs).
The harness pays the device→host transfer of the fitness tensor only
when an observer is attached; observerless runs are unchanged.

### Umbrella example coverage

No shipping example currently wires `PopulationReporter` end-to-end into
a report-client HTML report; `report_sphere_landscape_with_client`
exercises the M7 landscape playback surface but does not attach a
population observer, so its reports have no Population section. Wiring
a GA-on-Sphere example with `.with_observer(reporter.clone())` plus
`RecordingLayer` for the canonical EA metrics (`best_fitness` /
`mean_fitness` / `worst_fitness` / `best_fitness_ever`) is open work.

### Loading and caching

`src/inline_data.rs::read_all_population_samples()` walks the cached
episode records (`read_all_episode_records`) and concatenates every
record's `population_samples` vector behind its own `OnceLock`. RL-only
runs return an empty slice and the Population section `view!`'s out to
an empty span — non-EA reports add nothing to the rendered tree.

## Shipped since M8.1

The M8.2 chart-polish items have since landed in `src/charts.rs` /
`src/series.rs`:

- **Hover crosshair** with an exact raw-sample readout, accurate even on
  a decimated path (`interactive_line_view`).
- **Per-panel static SVG export** — a per-chart download button builds an
  `HtmlAnchorElement` and triggers it.
- **Downsampling for long series** — `downsample_minmax` decimates the
  drawn path (peaks/troughs preserved) while the tooltip still reads the
  full-resolution series.
- **Axis-mode toggle** (`step | episode | wallclock`) via the `AxisMode`
  enum and a reactive UI switch.
- **Multi-seed ±std bands** — `metric_band` / `BandPoint` /
  `distinct_seed_count` feed `band_chart_view`'s filled envelope.
- **Strip-plot overlay** on the box plot, toggleable via an "Individual
  points" button.
- **Threshold horizontal-rule annotation** on the diversity trace
  (`low_diversity_threshold`, user-editable).
- **Landscape heatmap background** (closed-form sphere / ackley /
  rastrigin, monochrome ramp) — `adapters/landscape.rs`.

## Still deferred

- **Lineage DAG** ([`evolution-population`](../../docs/specs.md) §3.3) —
  requires per-Strategy parent tracking. `Strategy::tell` returns
  `(State, StrategyMetrics)` with no parent map; threading parent
  indices through GA + CMA-ES + replacement strategies is its own
  multi-step effort. The schema field `parents_of_best` is already in
  place; the panel renders only when non-empty across generations.
- **Hybrid scatter** ([`evolution-population`](../../docs/specs.md) §4.1) —
  depends on a production `rlevo-hybrid` driver (`crates/rlevo-hybrid/src/lib.rs`
  is a skeleton). The schema field `inner_rl_returns` is in place;
  the panel renders only when non-empty.
- **Diversity computation** — `PopulationSnapshot::diversity` is
  emitted as `None` from `EvolutionaryHarness` because the harness has
  no strategy-agnostic geometry over the population tensor. A
  `Strategy::diversity(state) -> Option<f32>` extension is the natural
  follow-up; until it lands the diversity panel (and its threshold rule)
  suppresses cleanly.
- **Panel reorder + `localStorage` layout persistence** — the panel grid
  is still fixed-order and non-persistent across reloads.
- **BipedalWalker / CarRacing / Swimmer / Reacher / DoublePendulum**
  examples — fall out structurally from the shared `Box2dBodies` /
  `Locomotion2D` SVG renderer.

## Standalone development

Trunk can also serve the client standalone for fast iteration:

```bash
cd crates/rlevo-benchmarks-report-client
trunk serve
```

There's no inlined data when served standalone (the script blocks are
absent), so the client renders error banners — useful for debugging
the error-path UI.
